The attached HTML file is an embedable html file that converts Degree-Minute-Second values to Decimal Degrees, and Decimal Degree calculations to Degree-Minute-Second values. The accuracy of the calculator has been tested multiple times, but make sure to run your own check to verify its accuracy for yourself. The HTML file uses several input elements to supply values for a conversion function, converts using JavaScript, and outputs the answer to a span element. The conversion function uses two if statements, to differentiate between conversions. Each if statement contains its own conversion formulas and means to output its answers to the span element.
